    # If the dealer does have any of those cards (ace, a figure or a ten) then you'll have to stand and wait for the reveal of the other card.

    # # DEPENDS
    # If you have a Blackjack (two cards that sum up to a value of 21), and the dealer does not have an ace, a figure or a ten then you automatically win.
    # If the dealer does have any of those cards (ace, a figure or a ten) then you'll have to stand and wait for the reveal of the other card.
    # If your cards sum up to a value within the range [12, 16] you should always stand unless the dealer has a 7 or higher, in which case you should always hit.
